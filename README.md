# Ringer
I don't know why, but this is something I was asked for.

## How to

### Install

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Run

`python3 ./main.py`

or, you may simply open `index.html` file inside of local folder. If you wish to play ringer within your web browser.


### Change sound
Simply replace `tone.mp3` any other `.mp3` file. And, make sure it's `tone.mp3`
